[Figure-ground organization in natural scenes: Performance of a recurrent neural model compared with neurons of area V2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6635809/)

Event-driven implementation of a recurrent neural model to do figure-ground organisation in natural scenes. 
The model takes inspiration from [A model of proto-object based saliency](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004269891300240X) and is a follow up of the event-based implementation [Proto-object based saliency for event-driven cameras](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Massimiliano-Iacono/publication/338944489_Proto-object_based_saliency_for_event-driven_cameras/links/5e4fa0c4299bf1cdb9394761/Proto-object-based-saliency-for-event-driven-cameras.pdf).
